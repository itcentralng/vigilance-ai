# VIGILANCE AI
Picture this: you're walking down the street, witness a crime, and simply shoot a quick text to report it. No fuss, no complicated forms. But wait, there's more – our AI superhero kicks in to understand the message, figure out what went down, where and when it happened, and even how urgent it is. Cool, right?
## What's Cooking?
We're cooking up an AI-Powered Crime Reporting Service that's all about making crime reporting a breeze. It's like sending a message to a buddy, but instead, you're sending it to our AI that's ready to decode the crime jargon and deliver it to the right doorstep.
## The Why:
By turning text reports into organized insights, we're not just simplifying crime reporting – we're handing law enforcement agencies a whole new level of supercharged information. Think crime trends, hotspots, and patterns that can be total game-changers.We could turn it into something seriously impactful.
## Tools Used
1. Africastalking API
2. Open AI (Embeddings and Completion)
3. Supabase (PostgreSQL, pgvector)
4. NodeJS
